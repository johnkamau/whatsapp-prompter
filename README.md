# whatsapp-prompter
A simple script that will prompt you before you send a message to someone on Whatsapp Web.

This script only works on Chrome.

For this to work we'll need an extension that can inject script into a web page. I prefer to use Styler, this can be installed from this
link

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/styler/bogdgcfoocbajfkjjolkmcdcnnellpkb?hl=en

Once installed, simply copy paste the script into the Javascript/JQuery textbox in Styler while viewing the web.whatsapp.com tab.
